# coursera-cryptocurrency 100% score solutions
i haven't write much Java, and the code was edited with Sublime. please excuse me for the bad code style.

the original repo of this fork did not get 100% score for assignment 1/2.

95/100 for assignment 1, both versions of max fee handler scores 0.
i use a simple tree search algorithm to get the max fee solution

90/100 for assignment 2, however, the grader frequently gives the 'ran out of memory' error (i guess you may encountered it too) while i'm trying to improve the code, finally i gave up. As a result, the CompliantNode.java file i upload uses a cheat i found on the course forum
